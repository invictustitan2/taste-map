# Cloudflare Pages configuration for Taste Map frontend
# This is for static site hosting only - no Workers, D1, or AI bindings

# Project identity
name = "tastemap-frontend"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

# Pages-specific configuration
# The frontend is served as static files from the current directory
pages_build_output_dir = "."

# Note: All dynamic functionality (API, database, AI) is handled by the
# separate Cloudflare Worker at api/wrangler.toml
# The frontend makes fetch() calls to the API worker endpoints
