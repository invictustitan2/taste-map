# 🚀 Quick Start

This project is ready to run directly in your browser.

## Instructions

1.  **Unzip this file.**
2.  **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.**
    - You can do this by double-clicking it or dragging it into a browser window.
3.  **That's it!** You should see a simple placeholder for the game:
    - **Phaser/Canvas:** A colored rectangle or simple sprite on a dark background.
    - **Three.js:** A rotating cube.
4.  **Check the browser's developer console** to see a "Game initialized!" message.
5.  Open `game.js` and `config.js` in your code editor to find the `// TODO:` comments that align with the project's first steps. Start building!
