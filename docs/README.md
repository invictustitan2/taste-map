# TasteMap: Visualizing Your Film DNA

## Project Description
TasteMap is an interactive web application designed to help users understand and explore their unique cinematic preferences. By tracking movie ratings, the system builds a visual 'taste profile' that maps a user's film DNA across various dimensions like genres, themes, directors, and mood. This allows users to not only see their preferences at a glance but also discover new recommendations tailored to their individual taste landscape.

## Features
-   **Interactive Taste Profile Visualization**: Visually map film preferences using dynamic charts (e.g., radar charts, scatter plots).
-   **Movie Rating System**: Simple interface for users to rate movies and contribute to their taste profile.
-   **Film Attribute Analysis**: Quantify and categorize film attributes (genre, director, lead actors, themes, mood) for comprehensive mapping.
-   **Personalized Recommendations**: Discover new movies within specific regions of their taste map or based on their overall profile.
-   **Exploration Tools**: Filter and explore movies based on attributes, directors, or actors within the visual map.

## Technologies
This project is built with a focus on client-side rendering and interactivity, utilizing:
-   **HTML5**: Structure of the web application.
-   **CSS3**: Styling and responsive design.
-   **JavaScript**: Core logic, interactivity, and data processing.
-   **Canvas API**: For custom, high-performance 2D data visualizations.
-   *(Potential for charting libraries like Chart.js or D3.js for more complex visualizations)*

## Setup and Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/taste-map.git
    cd taste-map
    ```
2.  **Open `index.html`**: Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to run the application. A local development server (e.g., `Live Server` VS Code extension, `python -m http.server`) is recommended for a better development experience.
